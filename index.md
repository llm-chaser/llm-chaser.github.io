# About Me

<img src="/images/with_tiger.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Jiajun Wu (吴佳俊)** 👋  

I'm a third-year undergraduate student in the **Turing Class (Honors Program in Computer Science and Technology)** at **Central South University**, advised by **[Prof. Libo Qin](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/qinlibo/zh_CN/)** (whose Ph.D. advisor is **Prof. Wanxiang Che**).

My research interests primarily lie in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a particular focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Multimodal Intelligence**. I’m passionate about building impactful intelligent systems and contributing to open-source communities.

I am the **first author** of a paper submitted to **ARR (October 2025 round)**, with the **intended venue being ACL**.  
This work is conducted in collaboration with **[Guancheng Wan](https://guanchengwan.github.io)** (Ph.D. student at UCLA, Lei Jun Scholarship recipient, Wuhan University), who serves as the **corresponding author**.

I also collaborate with **[Qiguang Chen (陈麒光)](https://lightchen233.github.io/)** on multiple research projects within our lab.

I maintain the open-source project [**minimind-notes**](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/minimind-notes) under the **MLNLP GitHub organization**, which has received **42+ stars** 🌟.

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations — feel free to reach out via:
