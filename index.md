Hi, I'm **Jiajun Wu (吴佳俊)**

I'm a third-year undergraduate student in the **Turing Class (Honors Program in Computer Science and Technology)** at **Central South University**, advised by **Prof. Libo Qin**.

I am the **first author** of a paper submitted to **ARR (October 2025 round)**, with the **intended venue being ACL**.
