Running is more than a sport to me — it’s a mindset and a source of resilience.  

In 2023, I successfully completed the **Yueyang Marathon (42.195 km full course)**, a milestone that pushed my limits and left a lasting memory.

## 📷 Photography

Photography allows me to document beauty along the way, especially city streets, campus moments, and portraits of friends.  
A photo, to me, is not just a visual — it’s a memory frozen in emotion.
